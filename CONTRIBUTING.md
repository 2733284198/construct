# How to contribute

Thanks for contributing to construct! Just follow these single guidelines:
- You must follow the PSR-2 coding standard. More info [here](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md). With these tweaks:
    - The class namespace declaration must be on the same line as `<?php`.
    - Always use spaces!

- All features or bugfixes must have an associated issue for discussion. If you want to work on a issue that is already created, please leave a comment on it indicating that you are working on it.
